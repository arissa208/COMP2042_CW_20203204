BRICK DESTROY GAME
----------------------

This project is a game where player controls a paddle to make a ball hits bricks,
the original source code used was from FilippoRanza and was refactored and added more
features to make the code cleaner and to make it a more interesting game. Some challenges
I faced while doing this project was the MVC project design as it made the code not runnable and
the game kept showing bugs.
